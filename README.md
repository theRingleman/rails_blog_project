# rails_blog_project

This is my blog skeleton.

I plan on using this to set up future websites that need a blog added to it.

To run this simply clone or fork it, run bundle install and then rails s.

The authentication is devise and also has facebook-omniauth for signup and sign in.

Authorization is included with pundit. You can change the policies to how you see fit.

There are some tests, and as always I need to write more.

Thanks for looking and if you would like to use it feel free!
